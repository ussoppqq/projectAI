dimana kita bisa menyimpang obat ini vitamin, paracetamol, obat cair


Response:
The question is asking where one can deviate (or perhaps, *obtain*  is a better translation of "menyimpang") medications such as vitamins, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and liquid medications.  The phrasing is ambiguous.

The answer depends heavily on the intent behind the question:

* **Legally and safely:**  These items can be obtained at pharmacies (apotek), drugstores, and some supermarkets (depending on the country and regulations).  Vitamins are often also sold in health food stores.

* **Illegally:** Obtaining medications outside of legal channels is dangerous and illegal.  This could involve buying from unauthorized vendors online or from individuals.  The quality and safety of such medications cannot be guaranteed, and they may be counterfeit, contaminated, or ineffective.

Therefore, a responsible answer emphasizes the **legal and safe options:** pharmacies and licensed retailers.  Mentioning illegal sources would be irresponsible and could encourage unsafe behavior.  It's crucial to always obtain medications from reputable sources to ensure both safety and efficacy.
