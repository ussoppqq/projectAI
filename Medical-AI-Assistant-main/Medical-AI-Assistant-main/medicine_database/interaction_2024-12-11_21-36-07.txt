I cannot find information about a medicine called "Paratusin" in any major medical databases or pharmaceutical resources.  It's possible that:

* **The name is misspelled:**  There might be a slight variation in the spelling.
* **It's a regional brand:** The medication might only be available in a specific country or region not covered by my databases.
