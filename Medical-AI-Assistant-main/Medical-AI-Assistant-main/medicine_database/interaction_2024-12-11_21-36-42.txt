Please note:  I cannot provide specific information about a "BRAND name" paracetamol because "paracetamol" itself *is* the generic name.  Many brands exist worldwide, and their specific formulations, warnings, and dosage instructions may vary slightly.  The information below is for paracetamol (acetaminophen) in general and should not be considered medical advice.  **Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication.**

1. **Indications:** Paracetamol is used to relieve mild to moderate pain, such as headache, muscle aches, toothache, and menstrual cramps.  It's also used to reduce fever.

2. **Pharmacology:** Paracetamol's exact mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in pain and fever.  Unlike ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, it has little effect on COX enzymes in the periphery.

3. **Dosage & Administration:**  **This is crucial and varies by age, weight, and specific product.  Always follow the dosage instructions on the packaging or as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.**  Generally, for adults, a single dose is 500mg to 1000mg, repeated every 4-6 hours as needed, not exceeding 4000mg in 24 hours.  Children's dosages are significantly lower and are based on weight and age.  Always use a formulation specifically designed for children.

4. **Interaction:** Paracetamol can interact with several medications, including warfarin (blood thinner), alcohol (increases the risk of liver damage), and some anticonvulsants.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions with other medications you are taking.

5. **Side Effects:** Common side effects are rare at recommended doses and usually mild, including nausea, vomiting, and stomach upset.  Serious side effects are rare but can include liver damage (especially with overdose), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), and blood disorders.

6. **Pregnancy & Lactation:**  Paracetamol is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when taken at recommended doses. However, it's always best to consult with your doctor or midwife before taking any medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

7. **Precautions & Warnings:** Paracetamol should not be taken by people with severe liver disease.  It should be used with caution in people with alcohol dependence or kidney problems.  Prolonged use should be avoided unless advised by a doctor.  Do not exceed the recommended dose.

8. **Overdose Effects:**  Paracetamol overdose is extremely serious and can cause severe liver damage, potentially leading to liver failure and death.  If you suspect a paracetamol overdose, seek immediate medical attention.

9. **Storage Conditions:** Store paracetamol in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.

10. **Generic Name:** Acetaminophen (in the US) or Paracetamol (in many other countries).
