**Panadol (Brand Name)**

Panadol is a brand name of paracetamol (acetaminophen in the US and Canada).  Its country of origin is **Australia**.  However, it's manufactured and sold globally under various licenses.  The specific formulation and ingredients may vary slightly depending on the country of sale.  This information is for general knowledge and should not replace consultation with a doctor or pharmacist. **Always follow the instructions provided with your specific Panadol product.**


1. **Indications:** Panadol is used to relieve pain, such as headache, muscle aches, backache, toothache, and menstrual cramps. It's also used to reduce fever.

2. **Pharmacology:** Paracetamol reduces fever by affecting an area of the brain that regulates temperature.  Its mechanism for pain relief is not fully understood, but it's thought to inhibit the production of prostaglandins, substances that contribute to pain and inflammation. However, unlike many other pain relievers, paracetamol does not have significant anti-inflammatory properties.

3. **Dosage & Administration:**  Dosage varies depending on the specific Panadol product (e.g., tablets, capsules, liquid) and the age and weight of the patient.  **Always refer to the product packaging for the correct dosage.**  Generally, for adults, the recommended dose is 500mg to 1000mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 4000mg in 24 hours. Children's dosages are significantly lower and are strictly weight-based; consult a doctor or pharmacist for appropriate dosing for children.

4. **Interaction:**  Panadol can interact with other medications, including warfarin (a blood thinner), certain anticonvulsants, and some herbal remedies.  Long-term, high-dose use of paracetamol with alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage.  Consult your doctor or pharmacist about potential interactions before taking Panadol with other medications.

5. **Side Effects:** Common side effects are generally mild and include nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  Serious side effects, though rare, can include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), liver damage (especially with overdose), and low blood count.  Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any serious side effects.

6. **Pregnancy & Lactation:**  While generally considered safe in recommended doses during pregnancy and breastfeeding, it's crucial to consult a doctor or pharmacist before using Panadol if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant.

7. **Precautions & Warnings:** Panadol should be used cautiously in individuals with liver or kidney disease.  Avoid excessive alcohol consumption while taking Panadol.  Do not exceed the recommended dosage.  People with a history of allergic reactions to paracetamol should avoid using it.

8. **Overdose Effects:** Paracetamol overdose can cause serious and potentially fatal liver damage.  Symptoms of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes).  Immediate medical attention is crucial in case of an overdose.

9. **Storage Conditions:** Store Panadol in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.

10. **Generic Name:** Paracetamol (Acetaminophen in the US and Canada)
