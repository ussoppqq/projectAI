Dosage and availability may vary depending on the specific formulation and Indonesian regulations.

**3. Dosage & Administration:**  **This information is crucial and varies depending on the specific Indonesian formulation.  Always check the Indonesian packaging for accurate dosage.**  Generally, adult doses range from 200-400mg every 4-6 hours, but this should never be exceeded without a doctor's prescription. Pediatric dosages are significantly lower and are strictly weight-dependent.  Consult a doctor or pharmacist before giving ibuprofen to a child.  Ibuprofen is usually taken orally with water.
