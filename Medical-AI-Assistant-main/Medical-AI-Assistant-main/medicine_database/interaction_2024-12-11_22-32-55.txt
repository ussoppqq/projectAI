    * Fever reduction.


2. **Pharmacology:** Ibuprofen inhibits the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.


3. **Dosage & Administration:**  **This information is crucial and MUST be verified with a local Indonesian pharmacist or doctor.** Dosage varies significantly based on age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.  Generally, adult doses are higher than children's doses.  **Never administer medication based solely on online information.**
