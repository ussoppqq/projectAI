It's crucial to understand that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  The information below is for general knowledge only and should not be considered a substitute for consultation with a doctor or pharmacist in Indonesia.

Dosage and availability of specific brands can vary.

**Ibuprofen (Generic Name) in Indonesia**

**1. Indications:**

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and reduce fever and inflammation.  In Indonesia, it's commonly used for:

* Pain relief: headaches, toothaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, back pain, etc.
* Fever reduction
* Reducing inflammation in conditions like arthritis (though usually a doctor will prescribe a specific dosage and regimen for this).


**2. Pharmacology:**

Ibuprofen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, chemicals in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation.


**3. Dosage & Administration:**

This information is crucial and must be obtained from the specific packaging of your Ibuprofen medicine in Indonesia.  Dosages vary by age, weight, and the specific formulation (e.g., liquid, tablet). **Do not rely on information found online for dosing.**  Generally:

* **Adults:**  The usual dose is likely to be around 200-400mg every 4-6 hours, but this needs to be checked on the packaging.
* **Children:**  Dosing for children is strictly weight-dependent and must be determined by a doctor or pharmacist.  Never give adult-strength ibuprofen to a child.

**4. Interaction:**

Ibuprofen can interact with many medications, including:

* Other NSAIDs (increased risk of bleeding and ulcers)
* Blood thinners (increased bleeding risk)
* Lithium (increased lithium levels)
* Certain antidepressants (increased bleeding risk)
* Corticosteroids (increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers)

This list isn't exhaustive.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.


**5. Side Effects:**

* **Common:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness.

**6. Pregnancy & Lactation:**

Ibuprofen should be avoided during the late stages of pregnancy (third trimester) unless specifically prescribed by a doctor. Use during early pregnancy and breastfeeding should also be discussed with a doctor as it may pass into breast milk.


**7. Precautions & Warnings:**

* Individuals with a history of stomach ulcers, bleeding disorders, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, asthma, or allergic reactions to NSAIDs should use ibuprofen with caution or avoid it altogether.
* Elderly patients are more susceptible to side effects.
* Avoid alcohol while taking ibuprofen.


**8. Overdose Effects:**

Ibuprofen overdose can lead to serious complications, including nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, dizziness, and potentially more severe issues affecting the kidneys, liver, and central nervous system.  Seek immediate medical attention if an overdose is suspected.

Store ibuprofen in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, and out of the reach of children.


**10. Medicine Brand Names:**

Many brands of ibuprofen are available in Indonesia.  Specific brand names will vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation.  Check your local pharmacy for availability.
