Response:
Information regarding specific drug regulations and availability in Indonesia should be confirmed with Indonesian healthcare professionals or by checking the Indonesian Ministry of Health's website.  The information below is for general knowledge and should not be considered medical advice.  **Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication.**


**1. Indications:**

Ibuprofen, in Indonesia as elsewhere, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and reduce fever.  Its uses include:

* Mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, toothaches.
* Fever reduction.
* Inflammation associated with conditions like arthritis (though usually not the primary treatment for chronic arthritis).

**2. Pharmacology:**

Ibuprofen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

**3. Dosage & Administration:**

Dosage varies depending on age, weight, and the condition being treated.  **This information is for general knowledge only and should not substitute for a doctor's prescription.**  Always follow the instructions on the Indonesian packaging or as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.  Common adult doses may range from 200-400mg every 4-6 hours, but exceeding the maximum daily dose is dangerous.  Children's dosages are significantly lower and strictly weight-dependent.  

**4. Interaction:**

Ibuprofen can interact with several medications, including:

* **Other NSAIDs:** Increased risk of side effects.
* **Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid):** Can reduce the effectiveness of aspirin.
* **Blood thinners (anticoagulants):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Lithium:** Can increase lithium levels.
* **Certain diuretics:** Can reduce the effectiveness of diuretics.
* **ACE inhibitors:** May reduce their effectiveness.
* **Methotrexate:** Increased risk of methotrexate toxicity.

This is not an exhaustive list.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications and supplements you are taking.

**5. Side Effects:**

Common side effects:

* Upset stomach, heartburn, nausea, indigestion.
* Dizziness, drowsiness.

Serious side effects (though rare):

* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing).
* Stomach ulcers or bleeding.
* Liver or kidney problems.
* High blood pressure.
* Heart problems.

**6. Pregnancy & Lactation:**

Ibuprofen should generally be avoided in late pregnancy (third trimester) due to potential risks to the fetus.  Its use during the first and second trimesters should be carefully considered, and only under a doctor's supervision.  Small amounts of ibuprofen may pass into breast milk. The risks and benefits should be carefully assessed by a healthcare professional before use during breastfeeding.

**7. Precautions & Warnings:**

* Individuals with a history of stomach ulcers, kidney disease, heart disease, asthma, or allergies should exercise caution and consult a doctor before using ibuprofen.
*  Elderly individuals may be more susceptible to side effects.
*  Avoid alcohol consumption while taking ibuprofen.
*  Do not exceed the recommended dose.

**8. Overdose Effects:**

Ibuprofen overdose can lead to serious symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, and even seizures, coma, or death.  Seek immediate medical attention if an overdose is suspected.

**9. Storage Conditions:**

Store ibuprofen in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, and out of the reach of children.

**10. Medicine Brand Names:**

The specific brand names of ibuprofen available in Indonesia vary. Check your local pharmacy. Many will simply be listed as "Ibuprofen" generically, while others may have proprietary brand names.  The active ingredient is the important thing to verify.
