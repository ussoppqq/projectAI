It's important to note that I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice. The information below is for educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice from a doctor or pharmacist in Indonesia.  Always consult a healthcare professional before starting or stopping any medication, especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have pre-existing health conditions.  Information regarding specific dosages and brand names in Indonesia may vary based on regulatory approvals and local formulations.  You should always check the Indonesian package insert for your specific medication.

**Ibuprofen (Generic Name) in Indonesia:**

1. **Indications:** Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve mild to moderate pain, fever, and inflammation.  In Indonesia, it's commonly used for headaches, toothaches, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, and fever associated with colds and flu.

2. **Pharmacology:** Ibuprofen inhibits the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation.  By reducing prostaglandin production, ibuprofen alleviates these symptoms.

3. **Dosage & Administration:**  **This information is crucial but needs to be verified with an Indonesian pharmacist or doctor.**  Dosage varies significantly depending on age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.  The Indonesian package insert will provide the appropriate dosage guidelines. Generally, adult dosages are higher than children's dosages.  Ibuprofen is usually taken orally with or without food.

4. **Interaction:** Ibuprofen can interact with many medications, including:
    * Other NSAIDs: Increased risk of bleeding and stomach ulcers.
    * Blood thinners (e.g., warfarin): Increased risk of bleeding.
    * Lithium: Can increase lithium levels in the blood.
    * ACE inhibitors and diuretics: Can reduce their effectiveness.
    * Corticosteroids: Increased risk of stomach ulcers and bleeding.
    * Methotrexate: Can increase the toxicity of methotrexate.
    * Alcohol: Increased risk of stomach irritation and bleeding.

    **This is not an exhaustive list.** Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

5. **Side Effects:** Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, and headache.  More serious, though less common, side effects can include allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing), stomach ulcers, kidney problems, and cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke).

6. **Pregnancy & Lactation:**  Ibuprofen should generally be avoided during the third trimester of pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus.  Use during the first and second trimesters should only occur under strict medical supervision.  Small amounts of ibuprofen can pass into breast milk, so it should be used cautiously during breastfeeding.  Consult a doctor before using ibuprofen during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

7. **Precautions & Warnings:** Ibuprofen should be used cautiously in individuals with:
    * History of stomach ulcers or bleeding
    * Kidney or liver disease
    * Heart disease
    * Asthma
    * High blood pressure
    * Allergies to NSAIDs
    * Individuals over 65 years old


8. **Overdose Effects:** Ibuprofen overdose can cause nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, confusion, and in severe cases, kidney failure, seizures, and respiratory depression.  Immediate medical attention is required in case of an overdose.

9. **Storage Conditions:**  Store ibuprofen at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep it out of reach of children.  Refer to specific storage instructions on the Indonesian packaging.

10. **Medicine Brand Names:**  Many brand names for ibuprofen exist in Indonesia.  These vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation.  It's best to check with a local pharmacy for available brands.
