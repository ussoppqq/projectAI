**Ibuprofen in Indonesia:**

**1. Indications:** Ibuprofen is used to relieve:

* Pain, including headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, toothaches, and back pain.
* Fever.
* Inflammation (swelling and redness).


**2. Pharmacology:** Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, fever, and inflammation.


**3. Dosage & Administration:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.  **Always follow the instructions on the Indonesian product label or consult a doctor or pharmacist.**  General guidelines are often as follows, but these are not exhaustive:

* **Adults:**  Typically 200-400 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, not exceeding the maximum daily dose as indicated on the product packaging.
* **Children:**  Dosage is strictly weight-based and depends on the formulation (e.g., suspension, syrup).  **Never administer adult formulations to children.** Always follow the specific instructions provided for children's ibuprofen in Indonesia.


**4. Interaction:** Ibuprofen can interact with many medications, including:

* Other NSAIDs: Increased risk of bleeding and stomach ulcers.
* Blood thinners (anticoagulants): Increased risk of bleeding.
* Aspirin: Reduced effectiveness of aspirin.
* Lithium: Increased levels of lithium in the blood.
* Certain diuretics: Reduced effectiveness of diuretics.

This is not an exhaustive list.  Inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications you are taking.

**6. Pregnancy & Lactation:**  Ibuprofen should be avoided during the later stages of pregnancy (third trimester) due to potential risks to the fetus.  Use during the first and second trimesters should only be under strict medical supervision.  Small amounts of ibuprofen may pass into breast milk, so caution is advised while breastfeeding.  Consult a doctor before using ibuprofen during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.

**9. Storage Conditions:** Store ibuprofen at room temperature, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  Keep out of reach of children.


**10. Medicine Brand Names:**  Numerous Indonesian pharmaceutical companies produce ibuprofen.  Brand names vary and often include the generic name "Ibuprofen" followed by the manufacturer's name or a unique brand identifier.  Check Indonesian pharmacies for specific brands.
