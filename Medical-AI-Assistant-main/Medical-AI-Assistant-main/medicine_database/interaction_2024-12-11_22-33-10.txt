Response:
Information on Ibuprofen in Indonesia is best obtained from Indonesian healthcare professionals or official Indonesian pharmaceutical sources.  The following information is for general knowledge only and should *not* be considered medical advice.  Always consult a doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication.  Information may vary slightly based on the specific formulation.

**1. Indications:**  In Indonesia, Ibuprofen is likely indicated for the same purposes as in other countries:  relief of mild to moderate pain (such as headache, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, toothache), and reduction of fever.

**2. Pharmacology:** Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.

**3. Dosage & Administration:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on age, weight, and the condition being treated.  **This information is crucial to obtain from a doctor or pharmacist in Indonesia.**  Adult dosages are typically higher than children's dosages, and children's dosages are often weight-based.  Oral administration is standard.

**4. Interaction:** Ibuprofen can interact with many medications, including:
* **Other NSAIDs:** Increased risk of bleeding and stomach ulcers.
* **Blood thinners (anticoagulants):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Lithium:**  May increase lithium levels.
* **ACE inhibitors:** May reduce their effectiveness.
* **Corticosteroids:** Increased risk of stomach ulcers and bleeding.
* **Methotrexate:** May increase methotrexate toxicity.
* **Aspirin:** May reduce the protective effects of aspirin on the heart.

**This list is not exhaustive.** A doctor or pharmacist needs to assess potential interactions based on your specific medication regimen.

**5. Side Effects:** Common side effects may include nausea, heartburn, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, and drowsiness.  Serious side effects, though less common, can include:
* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Stomach ulcers and bleeding
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems
* High blood pressure
* Cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke) â€“ increased risk with long-term use and/or high doses.


**6. Pregnancy & Lactation:** Ibuprofen use during pregnancy, especially in the later stages, should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and only under strict medical supervision.  Small amounts may pass into breast milk, so its use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered.  Consult a doctor before using during pregnancy or lactation.

**7. Precautions & Warnings:**  Ibuprofen should be used with caution in individuals with:
* History of stomach ulcers or bleeding
* Kidney or liver disease
* Heart disease
* High blood pressure
* Asthma
* Allergies to NSAIDs
* Individuals taking other medications (see interactions)
* Elderly individuals (increased risk of side effects).


**8. Overdose Effects:** Ibuprofen overdose can lead to serious complications, including nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, confusion, seizures, and kidney failure.  Seek immediate medical attention if an overdose is suspected.


**9. Storage Conditions:**  Store in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.


**10. Medicine Brand Names:**  Many brand names for ibuprofen exist in Indonesia.  Checking local pharmacies or online Indonesian pharmaceutical databases is necessary to obtain a current list.  You will likely see variations based on dosage forms (tablets, capsules, syrups).
