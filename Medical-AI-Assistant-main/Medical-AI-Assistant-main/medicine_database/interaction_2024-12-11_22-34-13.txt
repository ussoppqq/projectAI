Please note: I am an AI and cannot provide medical advice.  The information below is for general knowledge only and should not be considered a substitute for consultation with a doctor or pharmacist in Indonesia.  Always follow the instructions on the packaging of any medication you purchase and consult a healthcare professional before taking any medication, especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are taking other medications.  Dosage and availability of specific brand names may vary across Indonesia.

**Ibuprofen in Indonesia**

1. **Indications:** Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and reduce fever. In Indonesia, it's commonly used for:

* Mild to moderate pain, such as headache, toothache, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, and back pain.
* Fever reduction.

2. **Pharmacology:** Ibuprofen inhibits the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin production, ibuprofen alleviates pain and inflammation and lowers fever.

3. **Dosage & Administration:**  Dosage varies depending on age, weight, and the condition being treated.  **Always follow the instructions provided on the specific Indonesian product packaging.**  A doctor or pharmacist should provide guidance.  General guidelines (which may NOT be applicable to all Indonesian formulations) often suggest:

* **Adults:**  200-400mg every 4-6 hours as needed, not exceeding the maximum daily dose (usually specified on the packaging).
* **Children:** Dosage is strictly weight-dependent and should be determined by a doctor or pharmacist.  Never give ibuprofen to children under a certain age without medical advice.


4. **Interaction:** Ibuprofen can interact with many medications, including:

* Other NSAIDs (increased risk of bleeding and ulcers)
* Blood thinners (increased risk of bleeding)
* Lithium (increased lithium levels)
* Certain diuretics (reduced effectiveness of diuretics)
* ACE inhibitors (reduced effectiveness of ACE inhibitors)
* Metotrexate (increased toxicity of methotrexate)

This is not an exhaustive list.  Always inform your doctor or pharmacist of all medications, supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking.

5. **Side Effects:** Common side effects include:

* Nausea
* Stomach upset
* Heartburn
* Dizziness
* Headache

Serious but less common side effects include:

* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Stomach ulcers
* Kidney problems
* Liver problems
* High blood pressure
* Cardiovascular events (increased risk of heart attack and stroke)

6. **Pregnancy & Lactation:** Ibuprofen should be avoided during the later stages of pregnancy (third trimester) as it may affect the baby.  During the first and second trimesters and breastfeeding, use should only be after consulting a doctor.

7. **Precautions & Warnings:**

* Do not take ibuprofen if you are allergic to it or other NSAIDs.
* Use caution if you have a history of stomach ulcers, kidney disease, liver disease, heart disease, or high blood pressure.
* Do not take ibuprofen with alcohol.
* Do not exceed the recommended dosage.
* Consult a doctor before using ibuprofen if you are taking other medications.

8. **Overdose Effects:** Ibuprofen overdose can cause serious complications, including nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, drowsiness, and, in severe cases, kidney failure, liver damage, and even death. Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect an overdose.

9. **Storage Conditions:** Store ibuprofen in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture. Keep out of reach of children.

10. **Medicine Brand Names:**  Many brands of ibuprofen are available in Indonesia.  Specific brand names will vary by region and pharmacy.  You will find the generic name "Ibuprofen" on the packaging along with the brand name.  Examples (which may not all be currently available):  It's important to check the local pharmacies for current options.  Brand names are not standardized across international markets.
