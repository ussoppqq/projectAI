**Ibuprofen (Generic Name) in Indonesia**

1. **Indications:** Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and reduce fever. In Indonesia, it's commonly used for:
    * Mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, toothaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, and back pain.
    * Fever reduction.
    * Inflammation associated with various conditions (always consult a doctor for inflammatory conditions).

2. **Pharmacology:** Ibuprofen inhibits the production of prostaglandins, which are chemicals in the body that cause pain, inflammation, and fever.  By reducing prostaglandin production, ibuprofen alleviates these symptoms.

3. **Dosage & Administration:**  Dosage varies depending on the individual, age, and specific condition.  **This information is not a prescription and should not be used as such.** Always follow the instructions on the packaging or as directed by a healthcare professional.  Generally:
    * **Adults:**  The usual dose is 200-400 mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding the maximum daily dose (consult the product label).
    * **Children:** Dosage for children is strictly weight-dependent and must be determined by a doctor or pharmacist.  Never give ibuprofen to a child without consulting a healthcare provider.

4. **Interaction:** Ibuprofen can interact with several medications, including:
    * Other NSAIDs (increased risk of bleeding and ulcers)
    * Anticoagulants (increased risk of bleeding)

    * ACE inhibitors (reduced effectiveness of ACE inhibitors)
    * Diuretics (reduced effectiveness of diuretics)
