**1. Indications:**

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce fever and treat mild to moderate pain.  Its uses include:

* Relief of pain from headaches, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, back pain, toothaches, and the common cold.
* Reduction of fever.
* Treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (in higher doses, usually requiring a prescription).


**2. Pharmacology:**

Ibuprofen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, hormone-like substances in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.  It does this by blocking the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), specifically COX-1 and COX-2, although it has more of an effect on COX-1.


**3. Dosage & Administration:**

**Adults:** The usual adult dose is 200-400 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, not to exceed 1200 mg per day.  Higher doses may be used for arthritis, but only under a doctor's supervision.

**Children:**  Dosage for children depends on their weight and age. It's crucial to follow the instructions on the product label or consult a doctor or pharmacist.  Never give ibuprofen to children under 6 months without consulting a doctor.  Liquid formulations are usually recommended for children.
