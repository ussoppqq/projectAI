**1. Indications:**

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain and reduce fever.  It's commonly used for:

* Mild to moderate pain, such as headaches, muscle aches, menstrual cramps, backache, toothache, and the common cold.
* Fever reduction.

**2. Pharmacology:**

Ibuprofen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.  It reduces inflammation by blocking the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, responsible for prostaglandin synthesis.  The exact mechanism by which it reduces fever is not fully understood but is likely related to its effect on the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates body temperature.

**3. Dosage & Administration:**

**Adults:** The usual adult dose is 200-400 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, not to exceed 1200 mg per day.  Always follow the directions on the label or as directed by a doctor.

**Children:** The dosage for children varies significantly based on age and weight.  **Never give ibuprofen to a child without first consulting a doctor or pharmacist.**  Over-the-counter formulations for children usually specify the appropriate dosage based on weight.

**4. Interactions:**

Ibuprofen can interact with many other medications, including:

* **Other NSAIDs:** Taking ibuprofen with other NSAIDs (like naproxen or aspirin) increases the risk of side effects.
* **Blood thinners (anticoagulants):** Ibuprofen can increase the risk of bleeding.
* **ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs):**  May reduce the effectiveness of these blood pressure medications.
* **Lithium:** Ibuprofen can increase lithium levels in the blood.
* **Methotrexate:** Ibuprofen can increase the toxicity of methotrexate.
* **Corticosteroids:** Increased risk of stomach ulcers and bleeding.
