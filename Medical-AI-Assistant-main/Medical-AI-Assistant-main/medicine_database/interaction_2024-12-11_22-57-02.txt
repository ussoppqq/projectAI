**1. Indications:**

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce fever and relieve mild to moderate pain.  Its uses include:

* Relief of pain from headaches, menstrual cramps, muscle aches, backache, toothaches, and the common cold.
* Reduction of fever.
* Treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions (often at higher doses and under a doctor's supervision).


**2. Pharmacology:**

Ibuprofen works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are substances in the body that cause inflammation, pain, and fever.  It's thought to achieve this primarily by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, especially COX-1 and COX-2.


**3. Dosage & Administration:**

**Adults:** The usual adult dose is 200-400 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, not exceeding 1200 mg per day.  Always follow the directions on the label or as directed by a doctor or pharmacist.

**Children:**  Dosage for children varies greatly based on weight and age.  **Never give ibuprofen to a child without first consulting a doctor or pharmacist.**  Overdosing in children can be particularly dangerous.  Liquid formulations are generally available for children.
